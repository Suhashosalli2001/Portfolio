            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Suhas T Hosalli  </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Bangalore, India.</span>
            <br />
            I am currently pursuing my MCA from PES University, Bangalore.
            <br />
            I have completed BCA from KLE Society's S Nijalingappa College, Bangalore.
            <br />
            I'm a passionate about building user-friendly and interactive web experiences. 
            <br />
            Projects that I have completed -
            <br/>
            1.Scientific and Age Calculator (Android Development) -
            I used Android Studio software to develop this application. 
            This was an android application which features of finding exact age of the user and also scientific and basic calculations.
           
            <br />
            2. Weather Forecast (Web Application)-
            Developed a Weather Forecast App using Angular for a responsive UI, displaying real-time weather data.
            Integrated RESTful APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch temperature, humidity, and conditions.
            Built a Node.js and Express.js back-end to manage API requests and secure data handling.
            Implemented asynchronous operations and error handling for smooth data retrieval.
            Optimized for performance and scalability to ensure seamless cross-deviceÂ functionality.
